# Matrix Multiplication Algorithms

Implementations of Strassen's Matrix Multiplication and Standard Matrix Multiplication algorithms.

#Execution

- Standard Matrix Multiplication<br>
  Running this file will generate a csv file named "StandardTimes.csv" with data points (n, executionTime).
  It will first output one run for n = 2 to ensure the implementation works properly.
  Then after a few minutes it will output "Done" to the console when all runs have completed.
